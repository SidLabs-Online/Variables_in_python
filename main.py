# What are variables in programming ?
# They are likes boxes where you can keep stuff and then use 'em when you need'

# What kind of things can you place in these boxes ?
# There are x 4 primitive data types that we can store in these variables or constants
# "=" sign is known as assignment operator 

# This is called an interger
var1 = 12 

#This is a called float
var2 = 23.45

# This is called a String
var3 = "Lancelot"

# This is called a Boolean
var4 = False

print(type(var1))
print(type(var2))
print(type(var3))
print(type(var4))

myList = [12,13,14,15]

myList.append(24)

print(myList)
